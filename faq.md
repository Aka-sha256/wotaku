# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

:::details Why does X site have so many ads?
**Use an Adblocker**. Ads keep the websites running, but sometimes the ad ruin the experience or even link malware. If you want ad-free experience you can do take these steps.

### Android
Install [**Firefox**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) and add [**uBlock Origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/). This should be more than enough. If you want system-wide support, try [**Adguard**](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html) or [**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io/). You can watch [**this video**](https://youtu.be/WUG57ynLb8I), if you need guidance.
### PC
Install [**uBlock Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com/) in your browser and you're done! If you want system-wide solution, you *can* use [**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io/) but it won't be as effective as uBlock Origin. You can also use [FastForward](https://fastforward.team/) or [Bypass.city](https://bypass.city/) to *bypass* redirects.
### iOS
[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io/) should cover everything for system-wide ads & trackers. You can also try [**AhaDNS**](https://ahadns.com/).

:::details Do I need to use VPN while downloading?
The necessity of using a VPN depends on the method of downloading. For direct downloads, a VPN is typically unnecessary. However, if you're engaging in peer-to-peer (P2P) activities such as torrenting, it's advisable to employ a VPN for enhanced security and privacy. Additionally, the legal ramifications in your area play a crucial role; if the consequences are lenient, you might opt to forgo using a VPN altogether. We have recommended some in [**quick start**](/qs.md#essentials).
:::

:::details Why's the download so slow?
Use a download manager. Some websites impose file transfer limits for a single thread, thereby restricting download speeds. Download managers overcome this limitation by leveraging multiple threads for downloading, resulting in faster download speeds. We have listed the recommended ones for [**pc**](/addons.md#downloader) and [**android**](/addons.md#phone).
:::

:::details What does X term mean?
We have explained meanings of a lot a weeb related terms in our glossary section.
- [**General glossary**](/glossary/general.md) for terms that are common in every medium
- [**Anime glossary**](/glossary/anime.md) for only anime specific terms
- [**Manga glossary**](/glossary/manga.md) for manga specific terms

For more general piracy related terms, you can check out [FMHY glossary](https://rentry.org/The-Piracy-Glossary). 
:::

:::details Can I track my anime/manga progress on websites?
Yes. Try [**MAL-Sync**](https://malsync.moe/). It has support for MyAnimeList, AniList, Kitsu, Simkl & Shikimori.
:::

:::details Why are some of the torrents red and some green on Nyaa.si?
- **Green**: Uploaded by trusted uploader.
![](/ss/nyaagreen.png)

- **Red**: For anime, it indicates a re-encoded video. For manga, it indicates that an edit of someone else's release, usually for the purposes of joining spread pages. Sometimes it's indicated with "ED" tag.

:::

:::details What is PT/Private Tracker, IRC, Usenet?
### PT/Private Tracker
Torrent trackers that don't allow you to freely make an account, but require you to get an invitation from an existing member or pass an interview. Some PTs also have specific periods where they allow for open signups.

### IRC
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a really old messaging protocol. It uses client and server connection to communicate. You can use various bot to download files in high speed. Follow [**our guide**](/guides/irc.md) to get started.

### Usenet
Usenet is a subscription-based service. You can download files using `.nzb` file (which is like a `.torrent`) and a usenet client. Even though it's really old, it's really convenient.

## Manga

:::details Where can I get the highest quality manga releases?
[Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/), [üçÄ/co/](https://boards.4channel.org/co/) & [Madokami](/guides/mado.md). Manga image quality depends on the [**source**](/guides/digim) and how it's been ripped, with volume release usually being better than [**CaaS**](/glossary/manga#publisher) release. If you want to download officially translated manga, [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/) is always the best source, though some of the rippers upload upscaled SD rips. We have listed the most trusted rippers in the Nyaa section. Madokami mainly mirrors the nyaa releases.
:::

:::details What's the best website to read manga?
Personal preference. Good online manga reading sites generally reupload nyaa releases (when it's available replacing/alongside the fantranslated one), but with added compression (e.g. [**Comick**](https://comick.io/home), [**Mangasee**](https://mangasee123.com/), [**MangaFire**](https://mangafire.to/home), [**Batoto**](https://battwo.com/v3x), [**Mangapark**](https://mangapark.net/)) & watermark on (almost) every page (mangafireüôÇ). On the other hand, generic ones only keep the fan-translated ones. You can read a short description about the sites [**here**](/websites.md#manga).
:::

:::details What's the best reader for manga?
### Android
[**Perfect viewer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer). Why? Because it has better scaling algorithm than others (including tachiyomi / mihon and kotatsu). But you wont get the luxury of directly reading from online sources in Perfect viewer. So, you have to balance between the sources.
### PC
There are a few options. [**CDisplayEx**](https://www.cdisplayex.com/), [**YACReader**](https://www.yacreader.com/), [**MComix**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/files/). You should give them a try and see which ones works the best for you. There is also [**OpenComic**](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic) which is really good for long strip comic.
:::

:::details What's the best extension for mihon / tachiyomi?
Like websites, it's also personal preference. But to us, [**Madokami**](/guides/mado.md) (in terms of quality) & [**Comick**](https://comick.io/home) (in terms of flexibility). There are also mangadex, batoto & others.
:::

:::details Why are the manga pages filled with squares / artifacts?
Moir√©. It generally happens during image downscaling. You can read about it in more detail [**here**](/glossary/manga.md#moire-moire).
:::

:::details Where can I download manga in bulk?
You can use multiple sources. [**Nyaa.si**](https://nyaa.si/), [**Madokami**](/guides/mado.md) or any other direct download websites like Comick or mangadex.

### PC
- For Nyaa.si, just use [**qBittorrent**](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). It's more than enough.
- For other DDL sites (mangadex, comick, madokami), use [**Free Manga Downloader 2**](https://github.com/dazedcat19/FMD2).

### Android
- For Nyaa.si, you can use [**libretorrent**](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/libretorrent), [**Flud**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delphicoder.flud) or [**1DM**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=idm.internet.download.manager&hl=en&gl=US). To browse nyaa.si, a browser is enough but there is also [**Nyanpasu**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhenxiang.nyaa) which is pretty nice.
- For DDL sites, tachiyomi / mihon is more than enough.
:::

:::details Where can I download manga in PDF?
Use CBZ / CBR / ZIP for manga. PDF can create issues in spread and other scenarios. If you really wanna read manga in PDF, use [**Free Manga Downloader 2**](https://github.com/dazedcat19/FMD2) to download as PDF (you have to select PDF format in settings) or [**ACBR**](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader) to convert CBZ into pdf.
:::

:::details How to compress cbz / cbr easily?
You can use the [**cbz/cbr file converter**](http://tomeko.net/software/CbxConverter/) to compress your comic files. It utilizes **ImageMagick 7.1.0** to convert the images. By default, it will use `.webp` and `-quality 75` as output parameters. You can configure these settings in the options menu.
:::

:::details How do I setup my own manga server?
Use [**Komga**](https://komga.org/). Read their [**docs**](https://komga.org/docs/introduction) to understand the setup process. You can join their [:ic-outline-discord:**discord server**](https://discord.gg/TdRpkDu) for further support.
:::

## Anime

:::details Where can I get the highest quality anime releases?
The quality of the anime file depends on the [**source**](/glossary/anime#source) as well as how it's been ripped and encoded. In general blu-ray release contains the best quality with reanimated, uncensored or extra scenes. [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/), IRC and some DDL websites don't compress the uploaded file.

<br>

On the other hand, aggregators like [**Aniwave**](https://aniwave.to/home), [**KickAssAnime**](https://kickassanime.am/) & [**HiAnime**](https://hianime.to/home) re-encode them further. They sacrifice some of the quality in favor of smaller file sizes, thereby maintaining a smoother user experience on their sites. [**KickAssAnime**](https://kickassanime.am/) has a player (duckstream) that streams using Crunchyroll API, so you can get full WebDL quality from there.

<br>

[**SeaDex**](https://releases.moe/) & [**Sneedex**](https://sneedex.moe/) rank their picks of the best quality rips for a variety of shows.
:::

:::details Which player should I use?
### PC
[**mpv**](https://mpv.io/) kinda covers everything for pc. We have listed everything you need for mpv in the [**video section**](/addons.md#tools).

### Android
For android, there is also [mpv-android](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android) but the UI is too limited. You can use [**Aniyomi**](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi)'s local option to watch anime. The UI is optimized with good amount of options.
:::


:::details Can I get Crunchyroll for free?
You can't get crunchyroll account for free but you can access their library for free using these methods
- [**Aniyomi**](https://aniyomi.org/): Yomiroll extension.
- [**Cloudstream 3**](https://cloudstream.on.fleek.co/): Anichi, Yomiroll (through Aniyomi Repo), Kronch

:::

## Music

:::details What's the best source for anime songs / OST?
- [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/) generally has a good amount of them. They upload both Digital-Rip & CD-Rip. 
- [**Sitting on Clouds**](https://www.sittingonclouds.net/), [SquidBoard](https://www.squid-board.org/) & [**Sukidesu OST**](https://sukidesuost.info/) upload ripped music from hi-res sources.
- Anime songs are uploaded on legal music streaming services. You can rip from these services using [:ic-outline-discord:**yet another music server**](https://discord.gg/JHCTtMVK), [**DoubleDouble**](https://doubledouble.top/) & [**Free MP3 Download**](https://free-mp3-download.net/),  which can rip multiple hi-res sources.
- You can also check out [**Nicotine+**](https://nicotine-plus.org/), a [**Soulseek**](https://www.slsknet.org/) client. People share their downloaded/own rips here. It uses P2P to transfer files, so a VPN is recommended.
- You can find more sources [**here**](/websites.md#music). If you want more ripping tools, you can check out more ripping tools in [others section](/addons.md#downloader).
:::

:::details What player should I use for music?
Personal preference.
### Android
There are FOSS player [**Oto Music**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piyush.music), [**Musicolet Music Player**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet) & [**Retro Music Player**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=code.name.monkey.retromusic). There is also [**Poweramp**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer.unlock) which is paid but it's really good.

### PC
You can try [**Foobar2000**](https://www.foobar2000.org/), [**Musicbee**](https://www.getmusicbee.com/) or [**AIMP**](https://www.aimp.ru/). Foobar2000, out of the box, has very outdated UI out of the box. You can sideload skins to make it more cool looking. Example: [Georgia-ReBORN](https://github.com/TT-ReBORN/Georgia-ReBORN), [Eole](https://github.com/Ottodix/Eole-foobar-theme) etc.
:::

:::details Can I track my music like anime or manga?
Yes. [**Last.fm**](https://www.last.fm/). It's not anime songs centric but a general music tracker.
:::

:::details What should I use to convert my music files?
Most of the PC music player can convert music files to your desired formats. For example [**Foobar2000**](https://www.foobar2000.org/) & [**Musicbee**](https://www.getmusicbee.com/). For Foobar200, you have to install [encoder pack](https://www.foobar2000.org/encoderpack).
