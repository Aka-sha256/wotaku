If you want to submit or correct a link instead of creating a pull request, please post an issue. This makes it easier for me to add it to the wiki, since I need to maintain the categories and markdown style.

## Follow the title format
___
For new links: `[New][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`

Example: [New][Software] - Mangaduck X
___
For correct/fixed links: `[Fix][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`
