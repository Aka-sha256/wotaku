# <img src="/static/rm/pr.svg" width="24px"> Submitting a link
If you would like to submit or correct a link instead of creating a pull request, please post an issue. It would be easier for me to add it to the wiki, as I need to maintain the categories and markdown style.

### Follow the title format
___
For new links: `[New][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`

Example: [New][Software] - Mangaduck X
___
For correct/fixed links: `[Fix][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`

Example: [Fix][Websites] - Kickassanime

*Please keep in mind that there is a possibility that I may not add the site if I don't like it or if the site is redundant*
