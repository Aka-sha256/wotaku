# <img src="/static/rm/x.svg" width="24px"> Websites I won't add

- Manga websites that compress uploads and do not offer multiple scanlation options.
- Anime websites that only scrape content from Gogo or Zoro.
- Websites and software that are intended for NSFW content only.
- Apps with outdated user interfaces or that only scrape content from generic websites (Gogo, Manganato, Manga4life etc.).

If you want to submit or correct a link instead of creating a pull request, please post an [issue](https://github.com/anotherduckling/Wotaku/issues/new). This makes it easier for me to add it to the wiki, since I need to maintain the categories and markdown style.
