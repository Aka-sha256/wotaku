#### Doujinshi

#### Long strip
It's newer type of comics format. Long strip comics are made for smartphone readers. The flow of the panels is up-down instead of traditional right-left. The panels are scrollable vertically so that it is easier to read in smartphone. As a result you have to follow [different rules](https://www.webtoons.com/en/tiptoon/lozolz/webtoon-editing-tips/viewer?title_no=1268&episode_no=24) than the traditional manga format. This format is widely used in the manhwa and manhua industries.


#### Omake
A bonus/extra chapter which doesn't really affect the main story. Generally gives artworks, character backgrounds, mangaka notes or an extra story.


#### One-Shot
A manga that's been published at once. The length of the story depends on the mangaka. Also, it can be serialized later. Example: [Kimi no Kaketeru Tokomo Suki](https://mangadex.org/title/690540ab-5f55-4b44-910d-4d2ed0a0faa9/kimi-no-kaketeru-tokomo-suki)

## Scanlation

#### Scanlator
A group that fan translate a manga/manhwa/manhua. The group takes the raw file and translate the whole manga (including dialogue, sfx & other forms of text). Also, sometimes the [wordplays](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Japanese_wordplay) & cultural references provided in that chapter are explained in the credit section.

#### Cleaner (CL)
Cleaner takes the raw file, fixes the faults (artifacts due to scanning, color shifts, tilts etc) & cleans all the original text (SFX too if needed). But these days, this can be only removing texts since digital raw is widely available.

#### Redrawer (RD)
Redrawer redraws all the parts erased parts by the cleaner and make it as smooth as possible. They patches everything that was affected due to scanning or other issues. Nowadays cleaning and redrawing are often done by a single person since these two are very closely related.

A good example of cleaning and redrawing process by Raj:
