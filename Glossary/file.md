# File Naming

![](/static/glossary/file/af.png)
## Anime

#### Release group
The individual or team behind the release, also called Encoder in the case of encodes.

#### Source
The origin of the release, so streaming sites or different disc releases (DVD, LaserDisc, BluRay, etc).

- **WEB-DL**: Untouched videos, downloaded from streaming sites without encoding
- **WEB-Rip**: Videos sourced from streaming sites that went through screen-capture and/or encoding methods
- **BDMV**: A capture of the raw file structure of a BluRay disc, needs to be mounted as a disc in order to be played and is used for making encodes or remuxes.
- **Remux**: Videos sourced from disc releases without encoding, making them have very high quality and file sizes.
- **Encode**: A video that has gone through lossless or lossy compression processes in order to save file size, also called a DVDRip of BDRip.
- **Re-Encode**: An encode that has gone through the process of further encoding, thus degrading in quality.
- **Mini-Encode**: A video where the priority is the smallest possible file size, even if the quality would greatly suffer as a result.

#### Resolution
The number of pixels contained in each frame, a higher value means improved quality (unless it's an upscaled release). The most common ones are 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 2160p. Most anime nowadays are made in 1080p.

#### Subtitles
- **Raw**: A video wtihout subtitles.
- **Fansubs**: Unofficial fan-made translations.
- **Hardsubs**: Subtitles that are burned into the frames and are part of the video track itself, can't be turned off.
- **Softsubs**: - Subtitles that are contained on their own track inside a video file or a separate file that's loaded with the video, can be turned on or off.

#### Video Codec
Used in the encoding process for compressing videos. The most popular ones today are x264 (AVC) and x265 (HEVC), with the latter being newer and able to achieve higher compression rates with less quality loss.

#### Audio Format
Used in the encoding process for encoding audio, divided into lossless and lossy formats.

- Lossless formats retain the  highest audio quality and have larger file sizes as a consequence. The most common ones are DTS, PCM, WMA and FLAC.
- Lossy formats aim to provide good quality while retaining smaller sizes. The most popular ones today are AAC, AC3, EAC3 (all commonly found in Web releases), with MP3 being found in older releases.

#### File Hash
A unique identifier calculated for each file used for checking its integrity and origin.

#### Video Format
The container used for the video file, with the most widely used one today being MKV, for the ability to put miltiple audio/subtitle tracks in one video file. The most popular one in the past was MP4, focused on being compatible with a wide range of devices, but only being able to have burned-in hardsubs.
