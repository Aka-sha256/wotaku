# Digital Manga Buyer's Guide
This guide is intended to help you decide where to purchase your digital manga depending on your needs.


## Things to consider when buying
- Image quality varies by publisher **and** by platform
- Convenience of platform apps varies, consider testing them if you plan to read without removing DRM.
- If you're not able to back up your purchases locally you could lose them entirely if a platform closes.
- DRM-free does not always mean "free from identifiable info".

> To simplify the guide, here "resolution" essentially means "quality".Although some publishers(e.g. Yen Press) offer low resolution images with minimal JPEG compression as "high quality", we will still consider this as low quality since most readers would see it that way.
