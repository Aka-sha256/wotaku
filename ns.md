## DDL

The basic process:
1. Copy the download link
2. Put it in the stream button

You can't play videos from some sources like Google drive, Mega etc. For this example, we will use [Tokyo Insider](https://www.tokyoinsider.com/). You can get more good DDL sites [**here**](/Websites.md/#ddl-1).

#### Step 1
Open the title you want to stream and scroll down to get the link. Click on the quality that you want to stream.

#### Step 3
Now paste the copied link in the media player and stream. For android users, there should be an option for `Network stream` or `Stream` in the side menu or videos section.

## IRC

Read the [full guide](/IRC.md) on IRC. When you start the download, a file will be created in the download destination. If you open the file while it is still downloading, you can play the downloaded sections. Technically, you are only able to play the parts that have been downloaded, so you cannot skip ahead and play the non-downloaded parts. This method works because the downloader downloads the file sequentially.
