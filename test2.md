# Digital Manga Buyer's Guide
This guide is intended to help you decide where to purchase your digital manga depending on your needs.


## Things to consider when buying
- Image quality varies by publisher **and** by platform
- Convenience of platform apps varies, consider testing them if you plan to read without removing DRM.
- If you're not able to back up your purchases locally you could lose them entirely if a platform closes.
- DRM-free does not always mean "free from identifiable info".

> For the sake of brevity and to avoid making this more technical than it needs to be, "resolution" here essentially means "quality", since these are often the same. Some publishers (Yen Press) though offer low resolution images with minimal JPEG compression ("high quality"). We will still consider this as low quality since most readers would see it that way.
