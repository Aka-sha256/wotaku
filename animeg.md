=== Cour, Season, Split-cour

In Japanese TV, the broadcast schedule is divided into four seasons: Spring (March - May), Summer (June - August), Autumn (September - November), and Winter (December - February). This means that an anime can have 13 episodes in each season.

- **Cour:** Each 13eps/season is called a cour.
- **Season:** The continuous run of an anime is called a season. It can be a 1 core (Example: [Chainsaw Man](https://anilist.co/anime/127230/Chainsaw-Man)), 2 core anime (Example: [Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba)) or a 4 core (Example: [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/NARUTO))
- **Split-cour:** When the anime season isn't continuous and has a break of one or two cour. Example: [Spy x Family](https://anilist.co/anime/142838/SPYFAMILY-Part-2)

| Terms     | Meaning { class="compact" } |
| ------ | ------ |
|  WEB-DL  |  When the video is downloaded from various OTT releases like Crunchyroll, HiDive, Netflix etc.  |
|  Blu-ray  |   Many anime series relese their blu-ray edition. The advantages of having a Blu-ray version will differ from one anime series to another. Some studios may fix various animation issues such as facial expressions, shadows, effects, color, and brightness. In some cases, additional scenes may be added or the entire animation may be redrawn. Also they will uncensor  scenes. However, it's important to note that not every Blu-ray release will have these enhancements. Here's [an Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdGXb41_KYk) of comparing a TV release with a Blu-ray release.  |
|  BDRemux  |   If a video is sourced from a Blu-ray, typically a Japanese one, without undergoing any encoding process. Remux files are generally very big in file size. Also you need good monitors and soundbox to get the full remux quality.   |
|  BDRip  |   The encoded version of the Blu-ray Remux. These are smaller in size compared to BDRemux. So easy to find since it's easier to host or seed.   |
|  x264 & x265  |   The codec x264 utilizes the H.264(a.k.a AVC) standard for compression while x265 employs the H.265(a.k.a HEVC) standard. x265 offers superior compression and supports higher resolutions, but its use requires more computational resources. In contrast, x264 enjoys wider support and can be played on a greater variety of devices, however, the video quality may not match that of x265 for equivalent bitrates.   |
|  Re-encode  |  Encodes an already encoded file, as a result loses more quality.  |
|  Mini encode  |   Encodes such a way that the sizes are really small. The main target is to get lower file size. So, it loses the quality. Mini encode of Blu-ray releases maybe worth keeping. Otherwise the qualities aren't that great.   |
|  Raw  |   The original file from the Blu-ray disk or OTT platform.   |
|  Fansub  |  Unoffical translated subtitles for the anime.  |
|  Hardsub  |  When the subtitle of the anime is encoded in the video. You can't change the font style but the sub won't get messed up because of the player issue.  |
|  Softsub  |   The subtitles are attached in the video but not encoded. As result, you can change the subtitle appearence. But. if the player isn't capable, it may mess up the subtitles if the subtitles have multiple layer. Also, you can have multiple subtitles in a single file.  |
|  Interpolation  |   Artificially creates frames in between to increase the fps. And **NO!. These are shit!** [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KRb_qV9P4g) why.  |
