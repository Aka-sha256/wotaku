### Manga

:::details Where can I get best quality manga release?
[Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/), [üçÄ/co/](https://boards.4channel.org/co/) & [Madokami](/guides/mado.md). Manga image quality depends on the [**source**](/guides/digim) and how it's been ripped, with volume release usually being better than [**CaaS**](/glossary/manga#publisher) release. If you want to download officially translated manga, [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/) is always the best source, though some of the rippers upload upscalled SD rips. We have listed the most trusted rippers in the Nyaa section. Madokami mainly mirrors the nyaa releases.
:::

:::details What's the best website to read manga?
Personal preference. DDL sites generally reupload nyaa releases, but with added compression (e.g. [**Comick**](https://comick.cc/home), [**Mangasee**](https://mangasee123.com/), [**MangaFire**](https://mangafire.to/home), [**Batoto**](https://battwo.com/v3x), [**Mangapark**](https://mangapark.net/)) & watermark on every page. You can read a short description about the sites [**here**](/websites.md#manga).
:::

:::details What's the best reader for manga?
[**Perfect viewer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer). Why? Because it has better scaling algorithm than others (including tachiyomi / mihon and kotatsu). But you wont get the luxury of directly reading from online sources in Perfect viewer. So, you have to balance between the sources.
:::

:::details What's the best extension for mihon / tachiyomi?
Like websites, it's also personal preference. But to us, [Madokami](/guides/mado.md) (in terms of quality) & [Comick](https://comick.cc/home) (in terms of flexibility). There are also mangadex, batoto & others.
:::

:::details Why the manga pages looks filled with squares / artifacts?
Moir√©. It generally happens during downscaling the images. You can read about it in more details [here](/glossary/manga.md#moir√©--moire).
:::

:::details Where can I download manga in bulk?
You can use multiple source. [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/), [Madokami](/guides/mado.md) or any other direct download websites like Comick or mangadex.

### PC
- For Nyaa.si, just use [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). It's more than enough.
- For other DDL sites (mangadex, comick, madokami), use [Free Manga Downloader 2](https://github.com/dazedcat19/FMD2).

### Android
- For Nyaa.si, you can use [libretorrent](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/libretorrent), [Flud](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delphicoder.flud) or [1DM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=idm.internet.download.manager&hl=en&gl=US). To browse nyaa.si, a browser is enough but there is also [Nyanpasu](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhenxiang.nyaa) which is pretty nice.
- For DDL sites, tachiyomi / mihon is more than enough.

### Anime

:::details Where can I get anime in best quality

The quality of the anime file depends on the [**source**](/glossary/anime#source) as well as how it's been ripped and encoded. In general blu-ray release contains the best quality with reanimated, uncensored or extra scenes. [**Nyaa**](https://nyaa.si/), IRC and some DDL websites don't compress the uploaded file.

<br>

On the other hand, aggregators like [**Aniwave**](https://aniwave.to/home), [**KickAssAnime**](https://kickassanime.am/) & [**Aniwatch**](https://aniwatch.to/home) re-encode them further. They sacrifice some of the quality in favor of smaller file sizes, thereby maintaining a smoother user experience on their sites. [**KickAssAnime**](https://kickassanime.am/) has a player (duckstream) that streams using Crunchyroll API, so you can get full WebDL quality from there.

<br>

[**SeaDex**](https://releases.moe/) & [**Sneedex**](https://sneedex.moe/) rank their picks of the best quality rips for a variety of shows.
