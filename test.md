+++ Long strip

It's newer type of comics format. Long strip comics are made for smartphone readers. The flow of the panels is up-down instead of traditional right-left. The panels are scrollable vertically so that it is easier to read in smartphone. As a result you have to follow [different rules](https://www.webtoons.com/en/tiptoon/lozolz/webtoon-editing-tips/viewer?title_no=1268&episode_no=24){target="_blank"} than the traditional manga format. This format is widely used in the manhwa and manhua industries.
