+++ 4 Koma

4-Koma (a.k.a. Yonkoma manga) features four panels, follows a specific pattern where every four panels lead up to a punchline. These are read up-down instead of traditional right-left. The right column is always the starting column. Example: [Tsurezure Children](https://mangadex.org/title/a840d47c-4080-4783-9c42-af8100e48079/tsurezure-children){target="_blank"}

+++ Long strip

It's newer type of comics format. Long strip comics are made for smartphone readers. The flow of the panels is up-down instead of traditional right-left. The panels are scrollable vertically so that it is easier to read in smartphone. As a result you have to follow [different rules](https://www.webtoons.com/en/tiptoon/lozolz/webtoon-editing-tips/viewer?title_no=1268&episode_no=24){target="_blank"} than the traditional manga format. This format is widely used in the manhwa and manhua industries.


+++ Spread

A splash page is a single panel that covers the entire page and is typically reserved for depicting an action-packed or dramatic scene.

They can sometimes cover multiple pages, which is solved by having fold-outs.
