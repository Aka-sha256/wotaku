## Panels

+++ General

| Type      | Manga         | Manhwa        | Manhua     { class="compact" }   |
|:---------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Direction | Right to Left | Left to Right | Left to Right |

The usual reading direction for manga is right to left, whereas manhwa and manhua are read left to right (like standard comics). In the case of manga, the individual panels are read right to left and top to bottom, then top again upon reaching the next page.

+++ 4 Koma

4-Koma (a.k.a. Yonkoma manga) features four panels, follows a specific pattern where every four panels lead up to a punchline. These are generally read up-down instead of traditional right-left. The right column is always the starting column. It can be single column or double column. For some manga or omake, it may follow right to left a.k.a. the traditional way.

To get what will be the path, you can look for the space between rows or column.

+++ Long strip

It's newer type of comics format. Long strip comics are made for smartphone readers. The flow of the panels is up-down instead of traditional right-left. The panels are scrollable vertically so that it is easier to read in smartphone. As a result you have to follow [different rules](https://www.webtoons.com/en/tiptoon/lozolz/webtoon-editing-tips/viewer?title_no=1268&episode_no=24){target="_blank"} than the traditional manga format. This format is widely used in the manhwa and manhua industries.


+++ Splash

A splash page is a single panel that covers the entire page and is typically reserved for depicting an action-packed or dramatic scene.

Another type of spread where the panel covers more than one page, but not the whole 2 pages.

They can sometimes cover multiple pages, which is solved by having fold-outs.
