==- How to contribute

## Websites I won't add

- Manga websites that compress uploads and do not offer multiple scanlation options.
- Anime websites that only scrape content from Gogo or Zoro.
- Websites and software that are intended for NSFW content only.
- Apps with outdated user interfaces or that only scrape content from generic websites (Gogo, Manganato, Manga4life etc.).

## Submitting a link
If you want to submit or correct a link instead of creating a pull request, please post an issue. This makes it easier for me to add it to the wiki, since I need to maintain the categories and markdown style.

### Follow the title format

- For new links: `[New][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`

Example: [New][Software] - Mangaduck X

- For correct/fixed links: `[Fix][Page title] - Webpage/Software Name`

Example: [Fix][Websites] - Kickassanime


> Please note that I may choose not to add the site if it is redundant or if it does not meet my preferences.
