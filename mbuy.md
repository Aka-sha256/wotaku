# Digital Manga Buyer's Guide
This guide is intended to help you decide where to purchase your digital manga depending on your needs.

> Here "quality" to essentially mean "resolution" below for brevity and to avoid making this more technical than most readers need it to be. These are often, but not always, related. Some publishers (Yen Press) will offer low resolution images with minimal JPEG compression ("high quality"). This will still be referred to as "low quality", as most average readers would see them that way.
___
## Things to consider when buying
- Image quality varies by publisher **and** by platform
- Convenience of platform apps varies, consider testing them if you plan to read without removing DRM
- If you're not able to back up your purchases locally you could lose them entirely if a platform closes
- DRM-free does not always mean "free from identifiable info"
