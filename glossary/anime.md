In Japanese TV, the broadcast schedule is divided into four seasons: Spring (March - May), Summer (June - August), Autumn (September - November), and Winter (December - February). This means that an anime can have 13 episodes in each season.

- **Cour:** Each 13eps/season is called a cour.
- **Season:** The continuous run of an anime is called a season. It can be a 1 core (Example: [Chainsaw Man](https://anilist.co/anime/127230/Chainsaw-Man)), 2 core anime (Example: [Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba)) or a 4 core (Example: [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/NARUTO))
- **Split-cour:** When the anime season isn't continuous and has a break of one or two cour. Example: [Spy x Family](https://anilist.co/anime/142838/SPYFAMILY-Part-2)
