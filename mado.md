# Madokami Joining Guide

[Madokami](https://manga.madokami.al/){target="_blank"} is a private website that hosts manga, novels, artbooks etc. They mirros manga rips from nyaa without compression. So, you can download from their site (upto 3 parallel download) or directly read in tachiyomi using their extension. To sign up in their website, you have to join their IRC channel and play gacha.

## Step 1
Install an IRC client, [!badge variant="dark" target="blank" icon="/static/icon/hex.svg" text="**HexChat**"](https://hexchat.github.io/){target="_blank"} if PC and [!badge variant="dark" target="blank" icon="/static/icon/rvl.png" text="**Revolution IRC**"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.mrarm.irc&hl=en&gl=US){target="_blank"} if Android. You can't use web IRC clients.

## Step 2
Connect to **Rizon IRC network**.
1. Add nickname for your account
2. Select RIZON in the networks list
3. Click Connect

## Step 3

!!!warning Readme
- Use a real e-mail address. Temporary and throw-away e-mail addresses are not acceptable.
- Check spam/junk folder too, if you don't see any reply in the inbox.
- Make sure that your password is longer than 5 characters
!!!

1. Register your current nickname by typing the following: `/msg NickServ REGISTER yourPassword your@email.address`
2. Now you should get a confirmation code like this

3. Copy and paste the confirmation code into the following command: `/msg NickServ CONFIRM ConfirmationCodeFromEmail`

> If the confirmation code above was copied correctly and still gives you an error, just type it out by hand. Copying seems to break it in some cases.

Now, your nickname is registered, and you've automatically been identified.
Upon your next visit to Rizon IRC network, use the same nickname, and identify using the following command: `/msg NickServ IDENTIFY yourPassword`

You can also set up your client to do this automatically by adding it to the Connect/Autorun commands for the Rizon network.

## Step 4

1. Type `/join #madokami` at the bottom command bar to join Madokami channel.
2. Now type `/msg sola REGISTER username password` in the Madokami channel. You shouldn't reuse the RIZON password here.

You will now see **Sola** at the left sidebar.

- If your lucky, sola will say "**ok enjoy ur account**"
- If unlucky, sola will say "**you are not favored, try again later**"

Repeat this step until you get an account, the cooldown should be 4 hours.

## Tachiyomi

2. Install the extension and go to it's settings page.
