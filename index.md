==- Duck's Note
- The lists are by default alphabetically ordered. If the list isn't in alphabetical order, it means that it has been arranged based on someone's preference, either mine or that of a contributor.
- The wiki contains ratings for various sites, which I have categorized to provide more detailed information than just using 'NSFW'.
	- [!badge variant="danger" text="R+"] Uploads NSFW content on a regular basis.
	- [!badge variant="ghost" text="R"] Uploads NSFW content, but not always/all of them.
	- [!badge variant="ghost" text="R-"] Rarely uploads NSFW content.
	- [!badge variant="success" text="E"] Only SFW content.
	- [!badge variant="ghost" text="NR"] Haven't been rated yet.
- If you encounter any issues with the websites or software listed, please reach out to their respective communities for assistance. If available, I have provided links to their GitHub pages where you can report the issue.
