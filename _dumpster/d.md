=== [**9anime**](https://9anime.gs/home)

- Watch together
=== Marin.moe
- Uploads blu-ray if available
- Self hosts the videos so doesnt compress the video a lot like third party hosting site
- Clutter-free design
- Lacks movie collection
=== Zoro.to
- Huge library
- Re-encodes shows for smaller size with minimal loss in video quality
- Watch together
- Softsub may create issues
=== AllAnime.to
- Scrapers Bilibili (`AK` player) with 1080p & better bitrate (some of them have 4K) but Bilibili doesn't have many [licenced shows](https://www.bilibili.tv/en/category?season_type=1%2C4).
